Instruction of Target Adjustment

{{ block content }}

<p>
    Your targets may be adjusted at between the first and second half if a period the ratio of 4-digit to 2-digit is higher and your goals are too difficult to achieve.<br>
    In that case, the standard for your compensation is not the initial target, but the adjusted target.
