#    if group.round_number == 1: #When the Constants.players_per_group is set to None, a list containing a single list (group) of all players is returned from the function get_group_matrix. For example, if there are 4 players and Constants.players_per_group is set to None, get_group_matrix will return [[<Player 1>, <Player 2>, <Player 3>, <Player 4>]] which is a list of all players contained in a list, pay close attention to the brackets. The reason why [0] is appending to self.get_group_matrix() is to extract that single list (group) of all players.

[(p3, p2), (p1, p4)] which is a list of tuples is transformed into [[p3, p2], [p1, p4]] which is a list of lists.
