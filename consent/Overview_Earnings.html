    <h4>
        Overview
    </h4>
    <p>
        Thank you for participating in this study!
    </p>
    <p>
        Please listen to the session administrator as they read the following materials. Feel free to read along to ensure you understand the information provided. Please pay attention as you will be taking a quiz covering the information contained in these materials. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In today’s session, you will participate in a labor market in which a firm seeks to hire an employee who will produce some output. Some participants in today’s session will assume the role of a firm, while others will assume the role of an employee. Later in today’s session, you will learn whether you will assume the role of a firm or an employee, and you will remain in your role for the duration of today’s session.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Earnings
    </h4>
    <p>
        The labor market consists of six independent rounds. In each round, you will have the chance to earn a payoff, which will be denoted in an experimental currency called Lira. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The amount of money you receive at the end of the study will be based on the total Lira you earn over the six rounds. We will determine a cash payment per Lira, where the payment rate per Lira results in $15 total compensation for the participant (or participants, if tied) who earned the most Lira, and $5.00 for the participant (or participants, if tied) who earned the least Lira. Everyone will receive something between $5 and $15, depending on the number of Lira earned, to result in an expected average compensation around $10.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your compensation will come in the form of an Amazon gift card, and you will receive your compensation within 2 weeks after the completion of the final study session.
