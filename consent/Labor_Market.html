    <p>
        At the start of each round, one firm will be matched with one employee. Each firm-employee match will interact with each other exactly once. So, if you assume the role of a firm, you will be matched with each employee exactly once. Likewise, if you assume the role of an employee, you will be matched with each firm exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each round consists of phases in which either the firm or the employee makes decisions. These decisions relate to a wage amount and a production level, which will determine the payoff for both the firm and employee. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The firm’s payoff is calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        Firm payoff = (120 × production level) - wage
    </p>
    <p>
        The employee’s payoff is calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        Employee payoff = wage - production cost
    </p>
    <p>
        Wage will be explained in Phase 1, production level and production cost will be explained in Phase 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        The phases in each round proceed according to the diagram below:
