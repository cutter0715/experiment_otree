        <b>Description of the research</b><br>
        You are invited to participate in a research study about the effects of wages on effort. The purpose of the research is to better understand how employee behavior changes with wage conditions. This study will include other participants from the University of Wisconsin-Madison who are enrolled in the BRITE Lab as interested in participating in behavioral experiments. This research will be conducted at the BRITE Lab on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What will my participation involve?</b><br>
        If you decide to participate in this research, you will be asked to take on the role of either a firm or an employee. The firm and employee will then proceed through a series of steps where a wage is set and an effort level is chosen. The firm and employee will then be shown their payoffs as a result of their prior decisions. Your participation will last approximately 30 minutes per session and will require 1 session.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Are there any risks to me?</b><br>
        While your participation in each session will remain anonymous from your peers, in order to provide you with compensation for your participation in this study, you will have to provide your name and email. This information will be kept on a secure server (Box) and only accessible by authorized researchers. However, this does represent a potential risk of loss of confidentiality.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Are there any benefits to me?</b><br>
        There are no expected direct benefits to you from participation in this study.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Will I be compensated for my participation?</b><br>
        Following the completion of all sessions of this study you cash payment per Lira will be determined. The participant (or participants, if tied) who earn the most Lira will receive $15 total compensation, and the participant (or participants, if tied) who earn the least Lira will receive $5.00 total compensation. Therefore, everyone will receive something between $5 and $15, depending on the number of Lira earned, to result in an expected average compensation around $10.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How will my confidentiality be protected?</b><br>
        Confidentiality will be protected by only using names and email for the express purpose of providing compensation to you following the conclusion of all experimental sessions. Names and email will be separated out from the data at the conclusion of the experimental session. All information collected as part of the research will not be used or distributed for future research studies. Only authorized researchers will have access to the data.
