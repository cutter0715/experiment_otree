                Wage is an integer between 20 Lira and 120 Lira (inclusive). This wage is fixed, meaning, the employee will receive the wage regardless of the production level.

                Wage is an integer between 20 Lira and 120 Lira (inclusive). This wage depends on the production level, meaning, the employee will receive the wage according to the following:

            <p>
                Wage =<ul><li>Agreed upon wage level if the production level is 1.0</li><li>15 if the production level is not 1.0</li></ul>
