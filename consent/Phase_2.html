        </p>
        <p>
            If the employee decides to exit the labor market, then the labor market for that round ends and both the firm and the employee receive zero Lira for the round.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the employee decides to enter the labor market, then they are informed the wage amount the firm has chosen (see screenshot below).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="{{ C.E2_CHOICE_ALTERNATE_LINK }}" alt = 'Employee Decision 2' class='decision_screenshot' width='auto' height='80'/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: during the six main rounds, “X” will be the wage amount Lira.
        </p>
        <p>
            The employee’s wage must be an integer between 20 Lira and 120 Lira (inclusive). That is, the employee’s wage must be in the range {20, 21, 22, …, 118, 119, 120}. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This wage is fixed, meaning, the employee will receive the wage regardless of the production level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, the employee is shown a list of possible payoffs for both the firm and the employee associated with the wage amount that has been chosen by the firm and any production level. For example, suppose a wage of 70 Lira was chosen, the table would populate with the following values (see screenshot below).
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Production Level</th><th>0.1</th><th>0.2</th><th>0.3</th><th>0.4</th><th>0.5</th><th>0.6</th><th>0.7</th><th>0.8</th><th>0.9</th><th>1.0</th></tr>
            <tr><th>Firm Payoff</th><td>-58</td><td>-46</td><td>-34</td><td>-22</td><td>-10</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>26</td><td>38</td><td>50</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Employee Payoff</th><td>70</td><td>69</td><td>68</td><td>66</td><td>64</td><td>62</td><td>60</td><td>58</td><td>55</td><td>52</td></tr>
        </table><br>
        <p>
            The employee then selects a production level (see screenshot below).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="{{ C.E3_LINK }}" alt = 'Employee Decision 3' class='decision_screenshot' width='auto' height='120'/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The production level is a number between 0.1 and 1.0 inclusive. That is, the production level must be in the range {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, …, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0}.
        </p>
        <p>
            The production level generates production costs, and the employee incurs these costs. The following table shows the production costs (in Lira) for each production level:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Production Level</th><td>0.1</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.9</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Production Costs (Lira)</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>18</td></tr>
        </table><br>

    {{ endif }}

    <p>
        The employee may then select "Next" to proceed to Phase 3.
    </p>

    {{ next_button }}
